In this blog post, I thought I would address my thoughts on the project
that I have just completed for the class fundamentals of software design.

##### 1. The Assignment
Our assignment was to create a website from scratch about an airline company.
This website needed to be fully inclusive of all the things that major companies
have such as admin, manager and user accounts with password protection, flight
plan tracking and pricing plus optional features that we could do on our own
like pdf receipt generation. This project also had to be an agile project
so there would be constant deadlines. We needed to collect requirements from our
teacher and develop and deploy a fully featured solution before the end of
the semester.

##### 2. Our Group

My partners were fantastic partners to have and our cohesion was awesome
throughout the project. Emma, a senior Electrical Engineering student,
and Alic, a Masters of Computer Science student, One of the first things
we had to deal with was communication. For this we decided to use Slack,
a popular group messaging service. Later in the project, we decided to use
Trello, a free feature tracking service that is very simple to use. These
tools and our constant communication led to our success

##### 3. The Architecture

For our architecture, we used Bootstrap, and JQuery on the front end and NodeJS
on the server side with Embedded Javascript (EJS) and AJAX passing information
between the two. This was a totally new experience for Emma and I. Because
of that, we ended up being useless for the first few weeks but once we
got a good hold of the language we ended up being huge contributors.
We had not even use Javascript before this project but we decided to jump
in and eventually we figured it out.

##### 4. Final Thoughts

To be frank, this project was the most stressful thing I have ever done in
programming. The constant deadlines, the problems that I assume come up in
every project, the under experience, and a multitude of other more subtle things
made this a great experience for me as a programmer and as a Software Engineer.
I learned how to adapt and create code in ways that I had never even dreamed
before. Things like the fact NodeJS is fully synchronised and the callback are
things I have read about but never used. Overall this project was great for me
and I genuinly think it prepared me for the future
