This is a prethought to my summer project working with TensorFlow.
After a few weeks of doing research based on my very limited knowledge of
the subject I think that I am going to move forward with this project.

##### 1. Prior Knowledge

Going into this project I know very little about the Python programming
language. I know that it is a relatively easy language to learn and I
have plenty of experience in programming so I am confident that I can
learn this language. TensorFlow is a library within Python. Because of
my lack of knowledge in statistics and my limited knowledge of linear
algebra I believe I am going to find this difficult.

##### 2. Ideas

1. Basketball predictive algorithm
2. Weather predictive algorithm
3. Climate effects predictive algorithm
