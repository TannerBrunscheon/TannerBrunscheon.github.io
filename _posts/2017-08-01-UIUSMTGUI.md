Over the summer I was asked by my superiors to use the programming skills
that I have acquired through the University of Iowa to create a tool
that adds an interface to a command line tool that we already use.

##### 1. Prior Knowledge
I chose to approach this problem as a Visual C# task. This program was
going to be exclusively Windows and C# seems to be something that is used
in the work place that I had just a bit of experience with but I could
use more in. I had done a bit of Visual development going into the project
but it had been years and I wanted to put my new knowledge to the test.

##### 2. Designing the Interface
My superior that gave me the assignment is not the most programming
knowledgeable person as he is an IT administrator not a programmer. I
took this opportunity to both work on my design skills and to work
on communication with people that have some experience in programming
but not enough to do it themselves. Communication was interesting because
of the vetos I had to do because of the technical limitations of the
software going so far as to dig through registry files to find the
information he wanted displayed. (User profiles are a pain in the rear)
I took this opportunity to figure out how to present these challenges
work towards a solution that will work.

##### 3. Programming
When I set out on this quest I expected it to be just a wrapper for an
already existing command prompt tool. How bad could it be? Little did
I know about the unique programming challenges that I would encounter
and the can of worms it would open for me as soon as the word got out
that I could fix some awkward problems in programming. One of my proudest
features is the automated use of folders and that the program only creates
folders if you select an automatically created folder as the folder you
want to back up to. It was these quality of life additions that were
programmed in that many wouldn't expect to be hard that gave the most
problems

##### 4. Final thoughts
To this day, I still support this program. I was able to present this
program to my peers and make a name for myself by doing so. A ton of
different colleges have come to me expressing interest in having me
program new tools and it seems like it will get a ton of uses over the
following year and I am always thinking of ways to improve it such as
adding self generating scripts so consultants can very easily create bat
files through the interface so if they must do many at a time, its a
breeze. This was my first end to end project I have ever worked on and I
couldn't be prouder.
