## About

Hello internet! My name is Tanner Brunscheon and I am a computer science and engineering student at the University of Iowa,
home of the Hawkeyes. To find my projects, you can look at my blog to see some of my commentary on projects as a whole
or you can head over to my Github page by clicking the little creature that is the Github logo at the bottom of the screen. If you want to learn
more about me personally you can also consult my blog. Thank you again for visiting my web page.
